This is the STACK OVERFLOWâ€™S COPY / PASTE KEYBOARD allusion. However the device can do a little bit more than original. It has one more button, Win key, for clipboard acses in default. You may check uot the model [here](https://a360.co/3Iui5j1).

## Hardvare

The project based on ATtiny85. 
We used [Digispark](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2043055746.html) board for MVP. Is's powerful enough for small projects.
Also it's less than $2. Not bad for USB interface and voltage stabilaser on board.

We used [Gateron mx switches](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32797603005.html). It's also cheep, about $1 for kit. 

3D printing is depend of your region. For box and lid it's necessary about 30 grams. In Russia it's cost less than $3. If you have friends with 3D printer, may be they print it for free. Seriously, it's less then regular setting's consumption.

Keycaps you can print as well. But remember, the small parts needs more attention during printing. May be it's better to buy it. The price is about $2 for kit.

I hope it's not a big deal to find out a few wires. At worst you may raid some broken USB cable or the patch cord. In hot swap's reasons you may solder stuf like [this](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32908826691.html). 

In 2 weeks we will complited the original board and order it's fabrication. The manifacturing data also will be here.
